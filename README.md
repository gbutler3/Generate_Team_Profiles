# Generate Team Profiles

## Task

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Description

Create an HTML profile page for your team using the command line.

## Use Case

As a manager of a team, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I am prompted for my team members and their information, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When I click on an email address in the HTML, my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- When I click on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- When I start the application, I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- When I select the engineer option, I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- When I select the intern option, I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- When I decide to finish building my team, I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:
